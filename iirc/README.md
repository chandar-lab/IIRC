![img.png](../docs/images/task_summary.png)

This package provides a way for adapting the different datasets (currently supports *CIFAR-100* and *ImageNet*) to 
the *iirc* setup and the *class incremental learning* setup, and loading them in a standardized manner.

The documentation and usage guide are available [here](https://iirc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Dataset Downloading Instructions
### CIFAR-100
To be able to run the code with *CIFAR-100* derived datasets, just download the dataset from the 
[official website](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-100-python.tar.gz) and extract it, or use the 
*./utils/download_cifar.py* file. 

### ImageNet
In the case of ImageNet, it has to be downloaded manually, and be arranged in the following manner: 
* dataset folder
  * train 
    * n01440764
    * n01443537
    * …
  * val 
    * n01440764 
    * n01443537 
    * …
